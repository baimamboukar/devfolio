## What

Netflix Clone is a pixel-perfect UI clone of Netflix I made using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Why

I built this project primarily to solidify my knowledge of React, and I wanted to see if I could recreate a simple yet pixel-perfect version of a popular web app. The main challenges with this project come from trying to emulate the different interactions and micro-interactions on Netflix such as side-scrolling and scaling title cards on hover.

## How

I used React to create reusable components that are styled using Tailwind CSS. I used Vite as a build tool.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: `React`, `React Router`
- **Styling**: `Tailwind CSS`
- **Deployment**: `GitHub Pages`
