## Why

I have used several form endpoint tools to handle form submissions for my portfolio and side-projects. Even though these tools are convenient to set up and use, they are not customizable to developer needs. I built Formend to meet such needs.

## How

I used Flask serverless functions as a backend framework and Postgres as a database. A form submission to any allowed endpoint on Formend is stored to a database table dynamically created for that endpoint. After the form data is stored, an email notification with the form body is sent to a pre-configured address. The project is powered by the Vercel platform.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: `Flutter | Dart | Flask`
