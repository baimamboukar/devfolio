## What
SOSbyCaasitech is an emergency response mobile application that connects users with immediate help during critical situations, featuring one-tap SOS alerts, location sharing, and direct communication with emergency services.

## Why
In emergency situations, every second counts. Traditional emergency response systems can be slow and require multiple steps. SOSbyCaasitech simplifies this process with instant alerts, automatic location tracking, and pre-configured emergency contacts.

## How
Developed with Flutter for rapid deployment across platforms, the app uses real-time location services, push notifications, and secure communication channels. Firebase handles user data, emergency contact management, and real-time message delivery to ensure help arrives quickly.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: `Flutter | Dart`
- **Location Services**: `Google Maps API`
- **Database**: `Firebase Firestore`
- **Real-time Communication**: `WebRTC | Firebase`
- **Deployment**: `Google Play | App Store`
