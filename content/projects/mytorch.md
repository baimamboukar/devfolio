# Project Details
status: "Active Development"
period: "September 2025 - Present"
role: ""

# About the Project
about:
  - "Built neural network library from scratch in Python and C++ replicating PyTorch functionality."
  - "Implemented core elements: activation functions (ReLU, GeLU, Sigmoid, Tanh), linear layers, batch normalization, optimizers (Adam, AdamW, SGD), allowing a 100% complete setup of MLPs."
  - "Implemented essential deep learning models including CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU and Transformers, and conducted three models training, confirming understanding of deep learning architectures."
