    abstract: "The development of generalizable electroencephalography (EEG) decoding models is a crucial step toward robust brain-computer interfaces and objective neural biomarkers for mental health. EEG decoding has historically been constrained by the lack of scalable models that generalize across individuals and cognitive tasks. Our project is motivated by the desire to address this gap by developing a zero-shot learning approach for cross-subject EEG decoding. We aim to build a large pre-trained model that captures domain- and subject-invariant neural representations to enable behavioral prediction, leveraging the large-scale Healthy Brain Network (HBN) dataset. Our work contributes to the growing effort to establish EEG as a robust tool for objective neuroscience and computational psychiatry, with potential applications in the development of EEG-based biomarkers for mental health, clinical assessment and adaptive brain-computer interfaces."

    abstract: "A classical vector retrieval problem typically considers a single query embedding vector as input and retrieves the most similar embedding vectors from a vector database. However, complex reasoning and retrieval tasks frequently require multiple query vectors, rather than a single one. In this work, we propose a retrieval method that considers multiple query vectors simultaneously and retrieves the most relevant vectors from the database using concepts from anomalous pattern detection. Specifically, our approach leverages a set of query vectors Q (with |Q| ≥ 1), and identifies the subset of vector dimensions within Q that standout (anomalous) from the rest of dimensions. Next, we scan the vector database to retrieve the set of vectors that are also anomalous across the previously identified vector dimensions and return them as our retrieved set of vectors. We validate our approach on two image datasets, a text dataset, and a tabular dataset."

    abstract: "Classifying Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary defense. While the official designation relies on simple metrics (Earth MOID and Absolute Magnitude H), we explore if complex dynamical relationships offer a robust, interpretable hazard assessment framework. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes defined by 11 orbital and physical features. Edges are defined using the Tisserand parameter relative to Jupiter (TJ) as a proxy for dynamical similarity, allowing the GNN to capture latent relationships among asteroid groups. Using the NASA/JPL Small-Body Database dataset, the model achieves an overall accuracy of 99% and an AUC of 0.99."

    abstract: "This research presents a vision-based approach to autonomous drone navigation and landing trajectory optimization, demonstrated for the calibration of Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPI). Traditional calibration methods require specialized aircraft equipped with photometric equipment, resulting in high operational costs ($15,000-25,000 per calibration), runway disruptions, and significant carbon emissions. Our proposed system leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect and classify PAPI light configurations under diverse environmental conditions. A convolutional neural network, trained on the LARD dataset comprising over 17,000 real and synthetic aerial runway images, enables accurate pattern recognition. This is integrated with a trajectory generation algorithm that aligns drone flight paths to evaluate and verify standard approach angles. The system achieves a modal classification accuracy of 97% in detecting PAPI light patterns and a fivefold improvement in angular measurement precision (±0.01° vs. ±0.05°)."

In Africa, sparse meteorological data and coarse ERA5 resolution underpredict contrails in cities like Nairobi and Lagos. This study uses a Random Forest model within PyContrails to infer upper-tropospheric humidity (RHi) from water proximity, forest density, and topography. Using global datasets, it achieves an R2 of 0.59 identifying water proximity as the main driver. African cities show only 32 contrail segments versus 450 in Europe, underscoring the model's potential to refine predictions and reduce aviation's non-CO₂ climate effects."
